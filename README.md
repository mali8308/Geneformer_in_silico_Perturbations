# _In Silico_ Perturbations - An Experimental Pipeline for Scalable Gene Expression Manipulation

This analysis is based on GSE174332

## What the Notebooks Do

### Task_1.ipynb
- It's a perturbation workflow
- You can load in your data 
- You can design single-gene or multi-gene perturbation assays
- And lastly you can perturb and export the perturbed data

### Task_2.ipynb
- This notebook simply runs the Geneformer model using Helical's API.
- The generated embeddings are exported for downstream analysis. 

### Task_3_Extra.ipynb
- This notebook is an in-depth analysis of the embeddings generated by Geneformer.
- We run PCA, UMAPs, and KNN models; we also calculate Fisher's Ratio and try to gauge if the centroids for the `ALS` state move any closer to the `PN` state. 
- Lastly we train an MLP to classify `PN` and `ALS` cells and bootrstrapp its predictions to build a distribution and calculate a p-value for all the false negative cells that were predicted to be `PN` but were actually `ALS` - cells that seem like the perturbation moved them closer to a healthier state's embeddings. 

### Task_4_New.ipynb
- This notebook plots the centroids of `ALS` and `PN` cells in the latent space using PCA.
- Additionally, we measure the Euclidean distance between these centroids and the Cosine similarity to detemrine whether the `ALS` centroids move any closer to the `PN` centroids in the perturbed states.
